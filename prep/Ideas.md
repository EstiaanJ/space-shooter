# Reflectors
reflect lasers
use a shader to reflect nearby sprites as well

# Shields
## Sprite & look
A shield is an invisible area around a ship. Maybe a shader can slightly distort the area underneath?
When a shield is hit the shield animation should play at the hit location which is a blueish light in the shape of the shield which is brightest at  the hit location. The animation it self is a wave travelling across the shield's surface


# Lighting
Use lighting effects for explosions, plasma, jets, shields etc
