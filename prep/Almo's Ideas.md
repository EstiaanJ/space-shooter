Most Important:
- Shield sprite when hit
- Engine sprite when moving
- Airburst sprite when strafing
- Kill counter
- Timer
- Faster spawning the longer you survive
- Damage numbers

Sooner rather than later:
- A dodge/teleport/bling/dash
- Radar/map/warning system
- Alternate fire like laser, missile or automatic rifle

Can happen later:
- Directional sprites
- More enemy types

Stuff Almo wants to work on:
- More animated sprites
- A more detailed background
- The mothership
- GUI
- Alternate ship sprites for upgrades
- Alternate fire sprites
- Different enemies

Wild Ideas:
- Different maps/sectors/solar systems/galaxies that you can go to with different enemies and/or factions.
- Environmental features, like planets, space stations, satellites, stars, asteroids, and gravity that you have to deal with.
