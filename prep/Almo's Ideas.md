Most Important:
- Shield sprite when hit
- Engine sprite when moving
- Airburst sprite when strafing
- Kill counter
- Timer
- Faster spawning the longer you survive
- Damage numbers

Sooner rather than later:
- A dodge/teleport/blink/dash
- Radar/map/warning system
- Alternate fire like laser, missile or automatic rifle
- Strafing needs to be nerfed/adjusted so that it only lasts a short time/distance and then has a short cooldown (for example 1 second).
- Shield regeneration needs to be nerfed/adjusted so that there is a small cooldown before it can start regenerating. You are currently basically impossible to kill. 

Can happen later:
- Directional sprites
- More enemy types

Stuff Almo wants to work on:
- More animated sprites
- A more detailed background
- The mothership
- GUI
- Alternate ship sprites for upgrades
- Alternate fire sprites
- Different enemies
- Unique particle effects. 

Wild Ideas:
- Different maps/sectors/solar systems/galaxies that you can go to with different enemies and/or factions.
- Environmental features, like planets, space stations, satellites, stars, asteroids, and gravity that you have to deal with. 
- Different spaceships and pilots with unique abilities. 
- Enemies drop scrap and the game is split into rounds that require you to kill a certain amount of enemies. When a round ends, you are able to spend your scrap at a shop.
